    <p>My Dearest Liz, <br> <br> I hope this letter finds you well and not hungover, I am writing this letter to express my infinite 
      love to you and improve my coding skills. <br> This is probably the gayest thing I did, but making you happy is worth a little 
      zest. I wanted to send you this letter to let you know that you are loved, and luckily enough by me (you should be grateful). 
      While creating this project, writing this letter was the hardest thing to do, expressing my love and manifesting it into 
      words is surprisingly hard for me. I think you're someone special and I wanted to tell you that. Your kindness, intelligence, 
      and beauty always make me proud to be your partner. Getting to know you has been one of the highlights of my life so far.
      I hope you have a great Valentine's Day filled with love from friends, family, and of course me. <br> <br> As always, I am 
      infinitely grateful to share this short life with you, and I hope I can share it with you again in the 
      hereafter. <br><br> Yours Forever, <br> Aj. 
    </p>
